# Differential Forms and Maxwell's Equations

## Gauss's Law in Differential Form
Lets revisit what we have learnt about Gauss's law for electric charges
```{math}
\iint_A  {\bf E} \cdot\,\mathrm{d} {\bf A} = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}
```
since the charge $Q_{encl}$ is enclosed within some closed surface area, that is the boundary to a volume, we can equally think about a charge density inside that 
volume:
```{math}
\iint_A  {\bf E} \cdot\,\mathrm{d} {\bf A} = \iiint_V \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\,\mathrm{d} V
```
If we recall the divergence theorem, it states that the flux of a vector field passing a closed surface area is related to the divergence of the vector field 
within the volume, so for an electric field
```{math}
\iint_A  {\bf E} \cdot\,\mathrm{d} {\bf A} = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot {\bf E}\,\mathrm{d} V
```
so we can write that, up to a boundary term
```{math}
\iiint_V \left(\nabla \cdot {\bf E} - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\right)\,\mathrm{d} V = 0
```
in order for this expression to be true for <em> any </em>  volume $V$ considered, the expression within the integrand must equal zero, meaning that:
```{math}
:label: divE
\nabla \cdot {\bf E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} 
```
Likewise we can do the same for magnetic fields, which in the absence of magnetic monopoles will look like:
```{math}
:label: divB
\nabla \cdot {\bf B} = 0 
```


## Amp√®re's Law in Differential Form
We can revisit Amp\`ere's law, with the displacement current:
```{math}
\oint_{\ell}  {\bf B} \cdot\,\mathrm{d} {\bf \ell} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0\epsilon_0\iint_A \frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t}\cdot\mathrm{d}{\bf A}
```
Given we know the Stoke's theorem tells us that the summing of a vector field around a closed loop will be related to the curl of the field, for the magnetic field:
```{math}
\oint_{\ell}  {\bf B} \cdot\,\mathrm{d} {\bf \ell} = \iint_A \left(\nabla \times {\bf B}\right)\cdot\mathrm{d}{\bf A}
```
Also we can think about the current $I$ in terms of a current density ${\bf J}$ through some conductor with surface area $A$, meaning that:
```{math}
I = \iint_A {\bf J}\cdot\mathrm{d}{\bf A}
```
which all put together gives:
```{math}
\iint_A \left( \nabla \times {\bf B} - \mu_0 {\bf J} - \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t}\right)\cdot\mathrm{d}{\bf A} = 0
```
in order for this expression to be true for <em> any </em> bounding area $A$ considered, the expression within the integrand must equal zero, meaning that:
```{math}
:label: curlB
\nabla \times {\bf B} = \mu_0 {\bf J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t}
```


## Faraday's Law in Differential Form
Finally looking at Faraday's law again:
```{math}
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\iint_A {\bf B}\cdot \mathrm{d} {\bf A} = -\iint_A \frac{\partial {\bf B}}{\partial t}\cdot \mathrm{d} {\bf A}
```
The EMF $\mathcal{E}$ can be thought of as a potential difference induced by the changing magnetic flux - in a circuit this potential difference pushes charges, 
causing a current to flow.  We can write $\mathcal{E}$ as a contour integral, summing up each of the infinitesimal electric field segments 
$\mathrm{d} {\bf \ell}$ in the circuit:
```{math}
\mathcal{E} = -\int_{{\bf r}_1}^{{\bf r}_2} {\bf E} \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf \ell} = \oint_c {\bf E} \cdot \mathrm{d}{\bf \ell}
```
where the final sign on the integral is given by the convention for clockwise conventional current.  {numref}`MagnetInACoil` shows that a positive 
change in $\Phi_B$ eventually produces current in a negative direction.  

We can rewrite this using Stoke's theorem:
```{math}
\oint_\ell {\bf E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \ell= \iint_A \left(\nabla \times {\bf E}\right)\cdot \mathrm{d} {\bf A} \nonumber
```
and so this can all be written as:
```{math}
\iint_A \left(\nabla \times {\bf E} + \frac{\partial {\bf B}}{\partial t}\right)\cdot \mathrm{d} {\bf A} = 0
```
in order for this expression to be true for <em> any </em> bounding volume $A$ considered, the expression within the integrand must equal zero, meaning that:
```{math}
:label: curlE
\nabla \times {\bf E} = - \frac{\partial {\bf B}}{\partial t} 
```


## Maxwell's Equations in Vacuum
We can collect together Equations {eq}`divE`, {eq}`divB`, {eq}`curlB` and {eq}`curlE` and present as Maxwell's equations:
```{math}
:label: MaxwellsEqns
\nabla\cdot {\bf E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}    \\
\nabla \cdot {\bf B} &= 0   \\
\nabla \times {\bf E} &= -\frac{\partial {\bf B}}{\partial t}   \\
\nabla \times {\bf B} &= \mu_0 {\bf J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t} 
```
These are <b>local</b> equations, they can be solved at points in space ${\bf r}$, rather than the integral form of each which are <b>global</b> equations - this 
is because they require us to think in terms of the bounding surfaces $\bf A$.  Another thing to notice is that the second / third of Maxwell's equations 
are <em>homogeneous</em>, they are sourced only by the ${\bf E},\,{\bf B}$ fields, whereas the first / fourth equations are <em>inhomogeneous</em>, being 
sourced by additional scalar/vector fields $\rho,\,{\bf J}$.  


## Maxwell's Equations in Matter*
Recall that all the Maxwell equations in {eq}`MaxwellsEqns` are only valid in vacuum, within matter however electromagnetic fields are better described in terms of the
${\bf E} \rightarrow {\bf D}$ and ${\bf B} \rightarrow {\bf H}$ fields, which we use to rewrite Maxwell's equations in matter as:
```{math}
:label: MaxwellsEqnsMatter
\nabla\cdot {\bf D} &= \rho_{free}   \\
\nabla \cdot {\bf H} &= 0   \\
\nabla \times {\bf E} &= -\frac{\partial {\bf B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times {\bf H} &=  {\bf J}_{free} + \frac{\partial {\bf D}}{\partial t} 
```
where $\rho_{free}$ and ${\bf J}_{free}$ represent charges that move within matter.  


## Magnetic Monopoles*
If magnetic monopoles were found to exist, then we could add the additional terms to Maxwell's equations that would need to be present:
```{math}
:label: MaxwellsEqnsBMonopole
\nabla\cdot {\bf E} &= \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\,\rho_E  \\
\nabla \cdot {\bf B} &= \mu_0 \,\rho_B  \\
\nabla \times {\bf E} &= - {\bf J}_B -\frac{\partial {\bf B}}{\partial t}  \\
\nabla \times {\bf B} &= \mu_0 {\bf J}_E + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t}
```
where $\rho_B$ is the monopole charge density and $\bf J_B$ is the monopole current density, which are the magnetic couterparts to the familar electric field 
$\rho_E,\, {\bf J_E}$.  We notice the increase degree of symmetry between the equations here now - all the equations are now inhomogeneous.

Additionally if there are $Q_B = \iiint \rho_B\,\mathrm{d}V$ which could move under magnetic (and therefore also electric) fields, we would have to amend the expression 
for the Lorentz force law in Equation {eq}`LorentzForce` :
```{math}
{\bf F} = Q_E\left( {\bf E} + {\bf v} \times {\bf B} \right) + Q_B\left( {\bf B} - \frac{1}{c^2}{\bf v} \times {\bf E} \right)
```
where $Q_B$ is a magnetic charge. No current evidence of these in nature, but symmetry breaking of GUT theories suggest they <em>should have existed</em> and ideas like 
cosmic inflation are proposed to explain the non-observation just as a vast dilution within our observable universe.  The observed quantisation of electric charge, into 
chunks no smaller than $\pm e$ can be explained by the presence of a <em>single</em> magnetic monopole in our universe, as Dirac proposed in 1931.  A good paper on magnetic 
monopoles is [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/00107514.2012.685693), Dirac's paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1931.0130) and for more on 
cosmic inflation, check out any good lecture course on, such as these from [DMTP](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/cosmo/cosmo.pdf).
