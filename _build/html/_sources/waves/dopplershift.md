# Doppler Shift

The observation of wave behaviour can be affected when at least one of the wave source and/or wave observer are in relative motion.  An example 
of this is shown in {numref}`DopplerShift`, where an ambulance siren is seen moving past an observer.

Effects on sound emitted by a moving source (here an ambulances siren) depending on whether the source is approaching $\lambda''$ towards or receding $\lambda'$ 
from an observer.
```
We start with a source frequency/time period $f_{source} = 1/T_{source}$, source wavelength of $\lambda_{source}$, wave velocity in the 
transmission medium $v$ and source velocity of $v_s$ with respect to the observer.  This relative motion gives rise to two complementary effects:

  
- Wave source <b>receding</b> from an observer, 

Since the source is receding from the observer, subsequent wavefronts get further apart, so the difference in observed wavelength grows each cycle by 
an additional factor:

```{math}
\lambda'' &=& \left(v + v_s\right)T_{source} \\ 
\Rightarrow \lambda'' &=& \left(\frac{v + v_s}{v}\right) \lambda_{source} \\  
\lambda'' = \frac{v}{f''} &=& \left(\frac{v + v_s}{f_{source}}\right) \\ 
\Rightarrow f'' &=& \left(\frac{v}{v + v_s}\right) f_{source}
```

- Wave source <b>approaching</b> an observer, 

Since the source is approaching the observer, subsequent wavefronts get closer together, so the difference in observed wavelength shrinks each cycle by 
an additional factor:

```{math}
\lambda' &=& \left(v-v_s\right)T_{source} \\
\Rightarrow \lambda' &=& \left(\frac{v - v_s}{v}\right) \lambda_{source} \\
\lambda' = \frac{v}{f'} &=& \left(\frac{v-v_s}{f_{source}}\right) \\ 
\Rightarrow f' &=& \left(\frac{v}{v-v_s}\right) f_{source}
```
  
We may find that if the observer is <em>also</em> in relative motion with respect to the medium, with velocity $v_o$ in same linear direction 
as $v_s$, then these expressions may be modified taking the form:
```{math}
f' = \left(\frac{v - v_o}{v - v_s}\right)f_{source} &\Longleftrightarrow& \lambda' = \left(\frac{v - v_s}{v - v_o}\right)\lambda_{source}\\ 
f'' = \left(\frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s}\right)f_{source} &\Longleftrightarrow&  \lambda'' = \left(\frac{v + v_s}{v + v_o}\right)\lambda_{source}
```
and variations can be found if $v_0$ and $v_s$ are in opposite directions.
