# Mathematical Preliminaries

## Flux
Lets think about a house pipe, as depicted in {numref}`HosePipe` with water of density $\rho$, moving through a hose pipe of cross sectional 
area $A$ with a velocity of $\bf v$,
```{figure} ../figures/HoseFlux2.png
---
name: HosePipe
---
Flux of water passing through a hose pipe, with cross sectional area $A$
```
We can see that the cross sectional area is perpendicular to the velocity in this case, so we define:
```{math}
{\bf A} = A\,\hat{\bf n}
```
where $\hat{\bf n}$ is a unit vector normal to the surface area $A$.  We can find the rate of mass flowing through the pipe, which is sometimes 
called the <b>Mass Current</b> $I_m$ of the water flow, with units of $[\textrm{mass}][\textrm{time}]^{-1}$:
```{math}
I_m = \rho {\bf v} \cdot {\bf A}
```
and so we can find the <b>Mass Flux</b> $\Phi_m$, with units of $[\textrm{mass}][\textrm{length}]^{-2}[\textrm{time}]^{-1}$
```{math}
\Phi_m = \rho {\bf v}
```
If we increase or decrease the size of the hose, we can figure out the flow rate of the resulting water flow using this mass flux, as we illustrate 
in {numref}`Flux`. 
```{figure} ../figures/Flux.png
---
name: Flux
---
<b>Left panel,</b> flux changes with increase to flow; 
<b>Middle panel</b>, flux changes with increase to area; 
<b>Right panel</b>, distorting the area can change the flux through it.
```
If we increase the size of $A$, the resulting mass current is smaller (water would flow slower out of hose) and likewise if we 
decrease $A$, then the mass current would be larger (water would flower faster out of the hose).  We notice that in this hose pipe example, the water 
flows the cross sectional area $A$ which is perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow, this may not necessarily be true in other systems. 
```{figure} ../figures/Flux3DdA.png

name: flux3DdA
---
Depiction of some 3D surface area $A$ decomposed into area elements $\mathrm{d} A$, with some vector field $\bf F$ shown in the red. The flux of the vector 
field is shown in blue as the components of $\bf F$ in the direction of the normal vectors $\bf n$ in $\mathrm{d} A$.
```
Consider the system shown in {numref}`flux3DdA`, where some vector field $\bf F(x)$ is passing through a surface with area $A$.  We can split up 
the area into smaller surface elements $\mathrm{d} A$ and consider the flux $\Phi$ passing through each of these.  In each surface element, 
we can define a surface normal $\bf n$ and then just resolve $\bf F$ into $\bf F_\parallel$ and $\bf F_\perp$ components, as shown in {numref}`flux3D`. 
```{figure} ../figures/flux3D.png
---
name: flux3D
---
A vector $\bf F$ passes through some surface (depicted in the green), <b>Left panel,</b> the situation for a flat surface, <b>Right panel</b> the situation for a curved surface.
Notice that in each case the setting up a surface normal vector at each position and resolving the vector $\bf F$ into parallel $\bf F_\parallel$ and 
perpendicular $\bf F_\perp$ components. 
```
Thus we will have the flux for each surface element $\mathrm{d} A$ as:
```{math}
\mathrm{d} \Phi = {\bf F} \cdot {\bf n}
```
and so the total flux will be described by summing up all of these components over the surface, which we can do with a closed surface integral:
```{math}
\Phi = \iint_A \left({\bf F} \cdot {\bf n}\right) \,\mathrm{d} A = \iint_A {\bf F} \cdot \mathrm{d} {\bf A}
```
## Divergence and Stokes Theorems
- For a vector field $\bf F$ within some volume $V$, bounded by a surface area $A$ with surface normal $\bf n$, as depicted in 
{numref}`divergencetheorem`, then we can relate:
```{math}
\iiint _{V}\left(\nabla\cdot {\bf F} \right)\,\mathrm{d} V = \iint_A {\bf F} \cdot \mathrm{d} {\bf A}
```

name: divergencetheorem
---
A pictorial look at flux of a vector field $\bf F$ crossing a bounding area $A$ which can be related to a divergence $\nabla \cdot {\bf F}$ within the volume $V$.
```

- For a vector field $\bf F$ within boundary $\ell$ of a surface area $A$ with surface normal $\bf n$, as depicted in {numref}`stokestheorem`, then we can relate:
```{math}
\int _{\ell}\,{\bf F}\cdot\mathrm{d} \ell = \iint_A (\nabla \times {\bf F}) \cdot \mathrm{d}  {\bf A}
```
```{figure} ../figures/StokesTheorem.png

name: stokestheorem
---
A pictorial look at a vector ${\bf F}$ on the boundary $\ell$ which can be related to the curl $\nabla \times {\bf F}$ within the area $A$.

##  Helmholtz Decomposition
The Helmholtz decomposition, shown in Equation {eq}`HelmholtzDecomp` states that a suitably smooth vector field $\bf F$ can, in general, be decomposed 
into two components:
```{math}
:label: HelmholtzDecomp
{\bf F} = -\nabla \phi + \nabla \times {\bf A}
```
where $\phi$ is a scalar field, also called the <b>Scalar Potential</b>, and $\bf A$ is a vector field, also called the <b>Vector Potential</b>.
