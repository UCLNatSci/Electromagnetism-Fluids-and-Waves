# Longitudinal Waves

## Derivation from masses and springs
Lets start with the classic derivation of waves propagating, with a collection of $N$ masses $m$ connected together on springs (with spring constant $k$), 
each with equilibrium separation $h$, as shown in {numref}`massspringarray`. We can measure the horizontal displacement $u(x,t)$ from the equilibrium positions.

```{figure} ../figures/massspringarray.png

name: massspringarray
---
Identical masses connected by identical springs.
```

If the springs follow Hooke's law, then $F_{H} = k\,u(x,t) $ and equally all the masses will follow Newton's second law $F_{N} = m \,a(x,t)$.  We can analyse 
the dynamics of the middle mass, where the Hooke's law forces will from both the spring $x+h \rightarrow x+2h$ as well as the spring $x \rightarrow x+h$
```{math}
F_N &= m \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)\\
F_H &= k[u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)] - k[u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)] \\
&= k[u(x+2h,t) - 2u(x+h,t) + u(x,t)]
```
Since these defintions are equal, then by rearrangement:
```{math}
:label: masschainforces
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t) = \frac{k}{m}[u(x+2h,t) - 2u(x+h,t) + u(x,t)] 
```
Lets also consider a chain of springs  in series, as shown in {numref}`springsinseries`  

```{figure} ../figures/springsinseries.png
---
name: springsinseries
---
Two springs in series with a mass
```

We can consider the total displacement of the mass $m$, as well as as the individual springs displacements 
```{math}
F_{tot} &= k_{tot}\,x_{tot}\\
F_1 &= k_1\,x_1\\
F_2 &= k_2\,x_2
```
If $x_{tot}$ can be broken up into the individual springs displacements $x_{tot} = x_1 + x_2$ then we simplify to:
```{math}
F_{tot} = k_{tot}(x_1 + x_2)
```
by rearrangement this reduces to
```{math}
\frac{F_{tot}}{k_{tot}} = \left(\frac{F_1}{k_1} + \frac{F_2}{k_2}\right)
```
Since the springs propagate the force applied through them, all the forces are the same $F_{tot} = F_1 = F_2$, so we are finally left with:
```{math}
\frac{1}{k_{tot}} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}
```
and therefore for two springs, the effective spring constant is:
```{math}
k_{tot} = \left(\frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}\right)^{-1}
```
If there are $N$ springs in series, then this result takes the form:
```{math}
\frac{1}{k_{tot}} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{k_N}
``` 
and if the springs are identical, $k_1 = k_2 = \dots = k_N = k$ this result reduces to:
```{math}
:label: totalspringconstant
\frac{1}{k_{tot}} = \frac{N}{k} \Rightarrow k_{tot} = \frac{k}{N}
```
We can substitute {eq}`totalspringconstant` into Equation {eq}`masschainforces`:
```{math}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t) = \frac{N\,k_{tot}}{m} [u(x+2h,t) - 2u(x+h,t) + u(x,t)]
```
Now if we want to consider the whole chain of masses and springs, then with $N$ masses and total mass on the chain is $m_{tot} = Nm$, which results in
```{math}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t) = \frac{N^2\,k_{tot}}{m_{tot}} [u(x+2h,t) - 2u(x+h,t) + u(x,t)]
```
and if the the total chain length is $L = Nh$, then:
```{math}
:label: almostwaveqn
\Rightarrow \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t) = \frac{L^2\,k_{tot}}{m_{tot}} \frac{u(x+2h,t) - 2u(x+h,t) + u(x,t)}{h^2} 
```
By taking the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ and therefore $h \rightarrow 0$ for a finite chain length $L$, this has exactly 
the form of the partial derivative in Equation {eq}`2ndpartialderiv`.  Hence Equation {eq}`almostwaveqn` has the form:
```{math}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t) = \frac{L^2\,k_{tot}}{m_{tot}} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u(x+h,t)
```
If we examine the units of the constants here:
```{math}
\frac{[L]^2\,[k]}{[m]} = \frac{m^2\,N\,m^{-1}}{kg} = \frac{m\,kg\,m\,s^{-2}}{kg} = m^2\,s^{-2} = [speed]^2
```
This results in the well known form of the wave equation in one dimension:
```{math}
:label: WaveEqn1D
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} 
``` 
where $c$ is the wave speed of some form (more on this later).  

## Longitundinal Wave Energy and Power
Given that waves are a method of propogating energy, it is an important question to ask how much and what parameters does a waves energy depend on!

Lets look at the total energy $E$:
```{math}
E = KE + PE
```
where $KE$ is the total kinetic energy and $PE$ the total potential energy. 

Gping back to the masses and springs model, the potential energy of each mass shown in {numref}`massspringarray` would be:
```{math}
PE = \dots + \frac{1}{2}k\Big[u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)\Big]^2 + \frac{1}{2}k\Big[u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots
```
where each of the springs in the chain will contribute to the PE of two masses, depending on their orientation.  Notice here that there are not any terms 
like $PE \sim \frac{1}{2}k u^2(x,t)$, this is because we haven't considered the effects at either end of the chain - although these<em> edge effects </em> 
are really important in real world systems, we will omit them here.  

Using the springs in series result from {eq}`totalspringconstant`, we can rewrite the PE in the form:
```{math}
PE = \frac{1}{2}\,N\,k_{tot} \left(\dots + \Big[u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)\Big]^2 + \Big[u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots \right)
```
and likewise if we introduce the size of the mass $m$ and then consider the total chain mass:
```{math}
PE &=  \frac{1}{2}\frac{N\,k_{tot}\,m}{m}\left(\dots + \Big[u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)\Big]^2 + \Big[u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots \right) \\
 &= \frac{1}{2}\,m\frac{N^2\,k_{tot}}{m_{tot}}\left(\dots + \Big[u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)\Big]^2 + \Big[u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots \right)
```
and then looking at the total chain length $L = N\,h$:
```{math}
PE = \frac{1}{2}\,m\,\frac{L^2\,k_{tot}}{m_{tot} h^2}\left(\dots + \Big[u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)\Big]^2 + \Big[u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots \right)
```
We recongise the term $c^2 = L^2\,k_{tot}/m_{tot}$ and as before by taking the limit of $N \rightarrow \infty \Rightarrow h \rightarrow 0$:
```{math}
PE = \frac{1}{2}\,m\,c^2\,\lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\left(\dots + \Big[\frac{u(x+h,t) - u(x,t)}{h}\Big]^2 + \Big[\frac{u(x+2h,t) - u(x+h,t)}{h}\Big]^2 + \dots \right)
```
and {eq}`partialderiv` tells us that each of these limits corresponds to a partial derivative, thus:
```{math}
PE = \frac{1}{2}\,m\,c^2\,\left(\dots + \Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x+2h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots \right)
```

Likewise the kinetic energy has the form:
```{math}
KE = \dots + \frac{1}{2}m\Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x,t)\Big]^2 + \frac{1}{2}m\Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + 
\frac{1}{2}m\Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x+2h,t)\Big]^2 + \dots
```

and so the total energy has the form:
```{math}
E = \frac{1}{2}\,m\,\left(\dots + c^2\Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 + \Big[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x+h,t)\Big]^2 +\dots \right)
```

We can think of this system as a coupled harmonic oscillator, with each mass having oscillating KE and PE but the result from {eq}`SHMenergy` tell us
that the total amount of energy for each mass is fixed, so by symmetry over the whole chain we can simplify this to:
```{math}
E = \frac{1}{2}\,m\,N\,\left[c^2\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \right)^2\right] 
= \frac{1}{2}\,m_{tot}\,\left[c^2\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \right)^2\right]
```
sometimes this is more usefully presented in terms of the energy per unit length or energy density $\epsilon(x,\,t)$:
```{math}
:label: massdensity
\epsilon(x,\,t) = \frac{E}{L} &= \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{m_{tot}}{L}\,\left[c^2\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \right)^2\right]\\
&=  \frac{1}{2}\,\rho_L\,\left[c^2\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \right)^2\right]
```
where $\rho_L$ is the mass per unit length or <b>mass density</b> of the mass and spring chain.  

We can use this expression to find the total energy transferred over a wavelength:
```{math}
:label: waveenergy
E_\lambda = \int_0^\lambda \epsilon(x,\,t) \,\mathrm{d}x 
```
Likewise to find the power or rate of energy flow over a wave, we can use the definition of power:
```{math}
P = \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
```
In order to get a sensible physical quantity, we can find the time varying power:
```{math}
:label: wavepower
P(x,\,t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\int \epsilon(x,\,t) \,\mathrm{d}x\right) = \int \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial t} \,\mathrm{d}x 
```
and then average the power over the time period $T$, using the definition for the average value of a function:
```{math}
:label: averagewavepower
\langle P \rangle_T = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T P(x,\,t) \,\mathrm{d}t 
```
