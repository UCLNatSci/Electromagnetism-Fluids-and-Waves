## The continuum hypothesis

So that we can use the tools of calculus, we treat the fluid as if it were continuous in structure and we regard physical quantities as locally uniform. This also means we can treat gases and liquids in the same way, since the equations of motion are independent of the particle structure.

An illustration of the idea is shown below, applied to measurements of density. We ignore molecular fluctuations, and consider a locally averaged measure of density based on the mean free path between atoms.

In actuality, the concept of "density" does not apply very meaningfully at the microscopic level, since the density at each point is defined by either being "inside" or "outside" an atom.
