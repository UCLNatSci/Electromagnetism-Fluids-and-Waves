    "An illustrated interpretation of vorticity is given below, looking only at the $z$-component for simplicity.

    "Consider a two-dimensional \"shear\" velocity profile described by $\\underline{v}=(u(y),0,0).$\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow is a rectilinear flow; meaning that it is not rotating as a whole, as can be seen from the image below. However, the vorticity is non-zero since fluid particles are rotated by the shearing force, as would be seen by an observer following the fluid.\n",

    "\n",

    "The vorticity is zero, meaning that fluid particles are swept round the origin without local rotation. To show this, we have to use the result for the gradient in cylindrical polars:\n",

    "## What is **flux**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a small (strictly infinitesimal) surface element $S$ within a field $\\underline{F}$, such that the surface normal makes an angle $\\theta$ to the direction of the field, as shown. The components of the field in directions parallel and perpendicular to the surface are illustrated in blue. The perpendicular component has magnitude $F\\cos{\\theta}$. The parallel component remains bounded by the surface.\n",

    "Multiplying the normal component of the field by the area of the surface element gives the volume indicated by the shaded cylinder in the image below. It is a scalar quantity, which tells us the instantaneous rate of flow through the surface per unit time. Mathematically, the flow rate across the surface $S$ is given by\n",

    "The quantity $\\underline{F}.\\hat{\\underline{n}}$ gives the flow rate *per unit area*, which is called the flux. Integrating the flux over a given finite surface area $A$ is equivalent to summing the individual surface element contributions to the flow rate, in the limit. The resulting flow rate $Q$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}Q=\\int_A{\\underline{F}.d\\underline{\\mathrm{S}}}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Most authors (including me!) use the terms flow rate and flux interchangeably, though flux is more pedantically defined as the flow rate per **unit** area. However, the intended meaning is almost always clear from the context and the surrounding text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Examples\n",
    "Net volumetric flux is the rate of volume flow across a given area, $\\displaystyle \\int_A\\underline{v}.d\\underline{S}$\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the flux $\\underline{F}.\\hat{\\underline{n}}$ is directly proportional to the field strength $F$. For this reason, the field strength is sometimes referred to as the *flux density*. This description fits quite well with field line depictions, since the field strength can be inferred from how close together (dense) the field lines are. However, the term flux density is more commonly used in the context of electricity and magnetism, and I will not use it in the fluids part of this module.\n",

    "## What is **divergence**?\n",
    "Suppose that a given point within  a field $\\underline{F}=(f_x,f_y,f_z)$ is surrounded by a **closed** surface, $S$ as illustrated below:\n",

    "Q=\\oint_S \\underline{F}.d\\underline{S} \\equiv \\int_V (\\nabla.\\underline{F})dV,\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\\nabla.\\underline{F}=\\biggr(\\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial f_z}{\\partial z}\\biggr).\\end{equation}\n",

    "By applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to {eq}`divergence_thm`, we obtain the result\n",
