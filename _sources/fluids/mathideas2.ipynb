    "The level sets of a function $\\phi(x,y,z)$ are generally surfaces, called *isosurfaces*. As an example, consider the pressure $p(x,y,z)$ in a volume of water, exposed to atmospheric pressure $p_0$ at the free surface. In this case, the boundary between the water and the air is an isosurface, defined by $p(x,y,z)=p_0$. Choosing other values of the constant $c>p_0$ will define other pressure isosurfaces within the body of water.  \n",

The image was [obtained](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228327330_Marching_Correctors_--_Fast_and_Precise_Polygonal_Isosurfaces_of_SPH_Data) by computational fluid dynmaic (CFD) simulation by researchers are ETH Zurich.\n",

On a relief/elevation map the contours indicate the height of the topographic surface (e.g. hills). On a weather map isobars show the constant pressure boundaries over the topographic surface, as illustrated by the example below from the [UK meteorological office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/maps-and-charts/surface-pressure).\n",

    "## The gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "**The gradient is perpendicular to the level sets**  \n",
    "Since level sets are defined by the relationship $\\phi=c$, differentiation gives $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}s}=0$. Using the result {eq}`mvarchain`, we find that on a level set\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since $\\hat{\\underline{v}}$ is parallel to the level sets of $\\phi$, the result result tells us that $\\nabla\\phi$ is perpendicular to the level sets of $\\phi$.  \n",
    "\n",

    "**The gradient points \"uphill\"**  \n",
    "From the definition of the scalar product, we know that\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\nabla \\phi$ and the direction vector $\\hat{\\underline{v}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is largest when $\\theta=0$. Therefore, $\\nabla \\phi$ points in the direction of maximum increase of the function $\\phi$ and has magnitude equal to the rate of maximum increase.\n",

    ":label: pot-fun\n",
    "Some velocity fields, called *potential fields*, may be defined as the gradient of a scalar potential $\\phi(x,y,z)$. For example, the gravitational field $\\underline{g}=(0,0,-g)$ can be made to satisfy $\\underline{g}=\\nabla\\phi$ by taking $\\phi=-gz$.\n",

    "## The stream function\n",
    "\n",
    "The stream function is a useful tool that can be used to find the streamlines for some types of flow. It applies only to two-dimensional flows $\\underline{v}(x,y)$ that satisfy $\\nabla.\\underline{v}=0$. The latter condition means that the fluid is *incompressible*. We will explore the incompressibility condition in later sections of the notes.  \n",

    "\\underline{v}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y},-\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The incompressibility condition $\\nabla.\\underline{v}=0$ is required for consistency, due to the equivalence of the mixed second derivatives (Schwarz' condition):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\nabla.\\underline{v}=\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y\\partial x}=0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The stream function also satisfies $\\underline{v}.\\nabla\\psi=0$ :\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\underline{v}.\\nabla\\psi=\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}+ \\left(-\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\right)\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}=0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $\\nabla\\psi$ is perpendicular to $\\underline{v}$, and so the contours of $\\psi$ are **parallel** to $\\underline{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the contours of $\\psi$ are streamlines of the flow.\n",

    "Find the stream function for the flow $\\underline{v}=\\left(x^2y,-xy^2\\right)$.  \n",
    "Use the stream function to produce a contour plot of the flow on $-2\\leq x,y\\leq 2$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Some three-dimensional flows can also be treated as two-dimensional. This is the case for flows that are *axisymmetric*, meaning that they are symmetric about a given axis. An example of an axisymmetric flow is shown in the image below, which is from another CFD simulation [produced](https://uk.comsol.com/blogs/creating-2d-models-from-3d-geometries-in-comsol-multiphysics/) using the commercial software COMSOL.\n",
