# Mathematical ideas 2

**In this section:**
* How are isosurfaces and isolines linked to the gradient?
* What is a "stream function" and does every flow have one?
* What is the "material derivative"?

## The directional derivative

According to the multivariate chain rule for a function $\phi(\underline{x})$, where $\underline{x}=(x(s),y(s),z(s))$,

\begin{equation}\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}s} =\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s}+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{{\mathrm{d}s}}+\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}s}\end{equation}

Using vectors, we can write this result as a scalar product:

```{math}
:label: mvarchain
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}s} = (\nabla\phi).\underline{v}, \qquad \underline{v}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s},\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}s},\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}s}\right),
```

where the gradient $\nabla\phi$ is given by

```{math}
:label: gradient
\nabla\phi = \left(\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x},\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y},\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z}\right).
```

Formula {eq}`mvarchain` looks strikingly similar to the one-dimensional chain rule, with the factor $\nabla\phi$ capturing variations in $\phi$ due to $x$ and the second factor $\underline{v}$ capturing variations in $\underline{x}$ due to $s$.  

If we evaluate $\nabla\phi$ at a given point $\underline{x}_0$, the multivariate chain rule gives us the rate of change of $\phi$ in direction $\underline{v}$. Since the parameterisation $\underline{x}(s)$ is arbitrary, we can choose a direction that we are interested in. This result is called the *directional derivative*. It is usually assumed that $\underline{v}$ is a unit vector, so the result may be denoted as follows:

\begin{equation}D_{\hat{\underline{v}}}(\phi)=(\nabla\phi).\hat{\underline{v}}\end{equation}.

```{exercise}
:label: ex-dir_deriv

Find the gradient of the function $\phi(x,y,z)=xyz$ at the point $\underline{x}_0:(-2,3,4)$.

What is the directional derivative of this function in the direction $\hat{\underline{v}}=\frac{1}{13}(3,-4,12)$?
```


## What is a **level set**

A level set of a function $\phi$ is defined by the following relationship, where $c$ is a constant:

\begin{equation}\phi=c\end{equation}

The main types of level set are surfaces and curves, as outlined below.

**Level surfaces**  
The level sets of a function $\phi(x,y,z)$ are generally surfaces, called *isosurfaces*. As an example, consider the pressure $p(x,y,z)$ in a volume of water, exposed to atmospheric pressure $p_0$ at the free surface. In this case, the boundary between the water and the air is an isosurface, defined by $p(x,y,z)=p_0$. Choosing other values of the constant $c>p_0$ will define other pressure isosurfaces within the body of water.  

The image below shows four isosurfaces (including the free surface) during the early stages of evolution of a tsunami. The image was [obtained](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228327330_Marching_Correctors_--_Fast_and_Precise_Polygonal_Isosurfaces_of_SPH_Data) by computational fluid dynmaic (CFD) simulation by researchers are ETH Zurich.

**Level curves**  
The level sets of a function $\phi(x,y)$ are generally curves, called *isolines*, isobars or contours. On a relief/elevation map the contours indicate the height of the topographic surface (e.g. hills). On a weather map isobars show the constant pressure boundaries over the topographic surface, as illustrated by the example below from the [UK meteorological office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/maps-and-charts/surface-pressure).

## The gradient

**The gradient is perpendicular to the level sets**  
Since level sets are defined by the relationship $\phi=c$, differentiation gives $\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}s}=0$. Using the result {eq}`mvarchain`, we find that on a level set

\begin{equation}(\nabla\phi).\hat{\underline{v}}=0, \qquad \underline{v}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}s},\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}s},\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}s}\right)\end{equation}

Since $\hat{\underline{v}}$ is parallel to the level sets of $\phi$, the result result tells us that $\nabla\phi$ is perpendicular to the level sets of $\phi$.  


**The gradient points "uphill"**  
From the definition of the scalar product, we know that

\begin{equation}\biggr|D_{\hat{\underline{v}}}\phi\biggr| = \biggr|\nabla \phi\biggr|\cos(\theta)\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\nabla \phi$ and the direction vector $\hat{\underline{v}}$.

The result is largest when $\theta=0$. Therefore, $\nabla \phi$ points in the direction of maximum increase of the function $\phi$ and has magnitude equal to the rate of maximum increase.

````{exercise}
:label: pot-fun
Some velocity fields, called *potential fields*, may be defined as the gradient of a scalar potential $\phi(x,y,z)$. For example, the gravitational field $\underline{g}=(0,0,-g)$ can be made to satisfy $\underline{g}=\nabla\phi$ by taking $\phi=-gz$.

Consider a two-dimensional velocity field $\underline{v}=(u,v)$, which is defined by a potential function
```{math}
\phi=x e^{-x^2-y^2}.
```
* Produce a vector plot of this field on the range $-2\leq x,y \leq 2$.
* On the same plot, illustrate some of the contours of the scalar potential.

The function needed to plot contours is part of the matplotlib library. Usage guidelines can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.contour.html).

## The stream function

The stream function is a useful tool that can be used to find the streamlines for some types of flow. It applies only to two-dimensional flows $\underline{v}(x,y)$ that satisfy $\nabla.\underline{v}=0$. The latter condition means that the fluid is *incompressible*. We will explore the incompressibility condition in later sections of the notes.  

The stream function $\psi(x,y)$ satisfies

```{math}
:label: streamfun
\underline{v}=\left(\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y},-\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\right)
```

The incompressibility condition $\nabla.\underline{v}=0$ is required for consistency, due to the equivalence of the mixed second derivatives (Schwarz' condition):

\begin{equation}\nabla.\underline{v}=\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x\partial y}-\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y\partial x}=0\end{equation}

The stream function also satisfies $\underline{v}.\nabla\psi=0$ :

\begin{equation}\underline{v}.\nabla\psi=\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}+ \left(-\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\right)\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}=0\end{equation}

Therefore, $\nabla\psi$ is perpendicular to $\underline{v}$, and so the contours of $\psi$ are **parallel** to $\underline{v}$.

In conclusion, the contours of $\psi$ are streamlines of the flow.


```{exercise}
:label: ex-strfun

Find the stream function for the flow $\underline{v}=\left(x^2y,-xy^2\right)$.  
Use the stream function to produce a contour plot of the flow on $-2\leq x,y\leq 2$.
```

Note: Some three-dimensional flows can also be treated as two-dimensional. This is the case for flows that are *axisymmetric*, meaning that they are symmetric about a given axis. An example of an axisymmetric flow is shown in the image below, which is from another CFD simulation [produced](https://uk.comsol.com/blogs/creating-2d-models-from-3d-geometries-in-comsol-multiphysics/) using the commercial software COMSOL.

## The material derivative

THIS SECTION NEEDS A REWRITE  

According to the chain rule for an arbitrary function $\phi(\underline{x},t)$,

```{math}
:label: chainrule
\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}+\frac{\mathrm{d}\underline{x}}{\mathrm{d}t}.\nabla\phi
```

If we put $\frac{\mathrm{d}\underline{x}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\underline{v}$, which defines the path of a fluid element, then we obtain :

```{math}
:label: materialderivative
\frac{D\phi}{Dt}=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}+\underline{v}.\nabla\phi
```

The differential operator $\frac{D}{Dt}$ is called the "material derivative" or "convective derivative".

The operator $\underline{v}.\nabla$ gives the directional derivative tangent to $\underline{v}$. It is often called convection, since it captures the motion/transfer arising due to the existence of the velocity field. For example, $\underline{v}.\nabla\underline{v}$ is called convective acceleration. The term $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ accounts for...

An illustration of the idea is shown below.

Suppose that a fluid particle follows the path marked in blue through the potential field $\phi$, which is indicated by the background colour scheme and equipotential contours shown. The vectors (arrows) shown on the plot depict the instantaneous gradient field of $\phi$. At each point on the trajectory, the experienced change in $\phi$ is given by the projection of the particle's own direction vector $\underline{v}$ with the gradient field, $\nabla \phi$, plus the instantaneous change in the potential field $\phi$ at that point due to time evolution.

The material derivative can also be applied to each element of a vector field $\underline{\phi}$, to give the change in $\underline{\phi}$ following the motion of a fluid particle.
