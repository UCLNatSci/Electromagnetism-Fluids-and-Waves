# Introduction

In this module you will apply the mathematical language of ODEs and vector calculus to study waves and understand phenomena in both classical 
electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. We will follow three units in turn through the module:

1. Waves
	1. An introduction to oscillations and waves
	2. Derivation of the wave equation
	3. Solving the wave equation
	4. Wave energy and power
	5. Dispersion relations
	6. Standing waves
	7. Matter waves

2. Electromagnetism
	1. Introduction electrostatics, Coulomb's law and Gauss's law
	2. Beginnings of magnetism up to Ampère's law
	3. Electromagnetic induction and Faraday's law
	4. Deriving Maxwell’s equations
	5. Electromagnetic waves

3. Fluid Dynamics
	1. Introduction to fluid mechanics
	2. Conservation of mass, energy and momentum
	3. Euler solutions and Benulli's equation
	4. Concepts of vorticity and rotational/irrotational flow
	5. Deduce special forms of the NS equations, such as for incompressible, adiabatic flow, steady flow
	6. Investigate classic fluid phenomena, such as surface waves in deep/shallow water
