# Introduction

In this module you will further develop the language of 
elementary vector calculus, developing a mathematical 
understanding of waves theory and phenomena to understand 
and address the classical equations of electromagnetism and 
fluid dynamics. We will follow various topics in turn through the 
module and consider briefly non-examinable extensions of some ideas 
(denoted with a * at the start of the subsection) - although these may 
be covered through coursework. 

You will cover:
1. Waves
	1. An introduction to oscillations and waves
	2. Derivation of the wave equation
	3. Solving the wave equation
	4. Standing waves
	5. Dispersion relations
	6. Wave Properties
	7. Matter waves

2. Electromagnetism
	1. Recap of the mathematics of scalar and vector fields, differential operators and the divergence and Stokes' theorem
	2. Introduction electrostatics and Gauss's law
	3. Beginnings of magnetism up to Amp\`ere's law
	4. Electromagnetic induction and Faraday's law
	5. Deriving Maxwellâ€™s equations

3. Fluid Dynamics
	1. Introduction to fluid mechanics
	2. Navier-Stokes (NS) equations
	3. Concepts of vorticity and rotational/irrotational flow
	4. Deduce special forms of the NS equations, such as for incompressible, adiabatic flow, steady flow
	5. Investigate classic fluid phenomena, such as surface waves in deep/shallow water
